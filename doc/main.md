This extension allows you to send tabs to other Firefox instances using
Firefox Sync.

It only sends the URI and title of the page, nothing else.

The extension requires Firefox Sync to be configured to work. Once
Firefox Sync has synced (usually happens just a few seconds after
Firefox starts), if you right click on a page or link, you should see
new menu options to send the page or link to another device.
