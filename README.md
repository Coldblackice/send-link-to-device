### [<sub>â¬‡</sub> Send Link to Device](https://github.com/JustOff/send-link-to-device/releases)

This add-on allows users of Pale Moon Sync to remotely open tabs on other Sync-connected devices.

To use this add-on, you must have Pale Moon Sync configured with two or more machines. Then, once Sync is initialized on Pale Moon startup, you should be able to right click on any link or anywhere inside a page and see an option to send it to another device. Just click the device you want to send to and the next time that device synchronizes with Pale Moon Sync, the link should open in a new tab!
